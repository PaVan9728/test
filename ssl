The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 or SSL 3.0. Version of SSL are
affected by several cryptographic flaws, including:
• An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.
• Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes. An attacker can exploit these flaws to
conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service
and clients.
• Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported version of the protocol
(so that these versions will be used only if the client or server support nothing better), many web
browsers implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade a connection
(such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that these protocols be disabled entirely.
• NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure communications. As of the
date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1, any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's
definition of 'strong cryptography'.



MITIGATION -
• Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
• Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.
